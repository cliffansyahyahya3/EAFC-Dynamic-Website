			<h2>WELCOME TO THE CLUB</h2>
			<p>Moves, looks and plays like football. EA SPORTS FC™ 24 brings you closer to football than ever before, 
            powered by a trinity of technologies driving gameplay realism in every match.</p>
			<blockquote>&ldquo;Continuous delivery that maintains the bases of previous editions, without making revolutionary changes but adding some new features that are quite promising. 
                If Ultimate Team is well managed throughout the year, 
                the mode could provide extra variety that was probably lacking in other seasons and 
                allow us to enjoy it in different ways.&rdquo;</blockquote>

				Vinicius Jr.</h3>
				<p>Real Madrid have announced that Vinicius Jr has won their Player of the Month award for March.

                    The Brazilian winger beat out competition from the likes of Karim Benzema, Fede Valverde, and Marco Asensio for the award.
                    
                    Vinicius was involved in seven games across all competitions for Madrid in February, in which he scored six goals and provided three assists.

EA FC 24 Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project is a multi-page website created using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript and jQuery used for basic interactivity. 

The site is themed around EA SPORTS FC 24 (A game I was heavily playing at the time) and was built to practice front-end web development fundamentals and page structure.

Project Purpose

  The goal of this project was to build a structured, responsive website layout while practicing styling, navigation, and simple interactive features using JavaScript.
